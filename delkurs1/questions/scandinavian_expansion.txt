# Study questions

Can we define this period? How do we do it? When did it begin and end, or why did it begin and end?

What sources do we have for this period? How does it affect our understanding of the Vikings that our sources for them are all geographically, culturally, or chronologically distant from them?

By the end of the Viking Age, Scandinavia had begun to integrate into the rest of Christian Europe. How did this happen?

Why was there a Scandinavian expansion, but no Scandinavian empire in the mid-11th century? Why were some of the effects of the Scandinavian expansion lasting, while others were only short-lived?
