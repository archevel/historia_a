# Scandinavian Expansion: Analysis of Source Materials

## Key Terms and Concepts

### Vikings! (What does this word actually mean?)

The term "Viking" has a complex etymology and meaning that evolved over time:

- **Original meaning**: The word derives from the Old Norse "víkingr," originally a Scandinavian appellative. Sawyer notes that in the ninth century, it was primarily the English who called the invaders "Vikings."

- **Geographic connection**: If the word originally referred to inhabitants of Viken (the land flanking Oslofjord), this could explain why the English specifically used this term, as England was "the natural goal for men from Viken who chose exile as raiders rather than submit to the Danes."

- **Contemporary terminology**: Other peoples described Scandinavians differently - they were often identified as Danes or Northmen in western Europe, sometimes called heathens or gentiles. In the east, Slavs called them "Rus," derived from the Finnish name for the Svear.

- **Modern usage**: The word now has a wider meaning, describing not only Viking warriors but also many aspects of Scandinavian society during what is commonly called the Viking Age.

### Councils and Trade

The expansion was closely linked to commercial developments:

- **Commercial expansion catalyst**: A key factor in the outburst of piracy was the commercial expansion in north-west Europe beginning in the late 7th century, with significant increase in trade between the Continent and England.

- **Trading places**: This led to development of large trading centers including Dorestad on the Rhine, Quentovic near Boulogne, and in England: Hamwic (Southampton's precursor), Fordwich (Canterbury's port), London, Ipswich, and York.

- **Baltic trade networks**: Scandinavian trading places included Ribe, Birka, Wollin, Truso, and later Hedeby, where furs and other northern products were traded.

- **Eastern trade**: The Svear established extensive trade networks in eastern Europe, with Staraja Ladoga as an early base controlling the river Volkhov route between the Baltic and interior Russia.

### Settlement, Colonization, Conquest

The Scandinavian expansion involved different forms of territorial control:

- **Initial raiding phase**: Early Vikings were primarily seeking wealth, not land - acquiring treasure in the form of gold, silver, gems, precious objects, or coins through plunder, tribute, or ransom.

- **Settlement patterns**: Different regions experienced different types of Scandinavian presence:
  - **Norway**: Colonization of previously uninhabited Atlantic islands (Orkney, Shetland, Hebrides, Iceland, Greenland)
  - **Denmark**: Conquest and settlement in eastern England, creation of the "Great Army" territories
  - **Mixed approaches**: Ireland saw establishment of fortified bases, Normandy received land grants from Frankish kings

- **The Great Army**: Starting in 865, this coalition of Viking forces conquered much of eastern England, establishing Scandinavian control over Northumbria, East Anglia, and parts of Mercia.

### Cultural Assimilation

The process of integration varied significantly by region:

- **Linguistic evidence**: Areas of densest Scandinavian settlement are indicated by concentrations of Scandinavian place-names, with influence on farming vocabulary and field-names confirming agricultural settlement.

- **Religious conversion**: Initially characterized by destruction of ecclesiastical sites, but conversion to Christianity began fairly rapidly. Stone crosses erected across northern England in the 10th century show enthusiasm for Christianity among the Anglo-Scandinavian elite.

- **Regional identity**: By Edgar's reign (959-975), inhabitants of the 'Danelaw' perceived themselves as different from the rest of England, creating a distinct regional identity from the intermingling of Scandinavian and English peoples.

- **Slavicization in the East**: Rulers of Kiev, though of Scandinavian descent, became Slavicized by the end of the 9th century, reflected in the change from Scandinavian names (Igor, Olga) to Slavic names (Svjatoslav).

### Danish Law

The legal systems established in areas of Scandinavian settlement:

- **Danelaw territory**: Areas of England under Scandinavian control developed distinct legal traditions. The Alfred-Guthrum treaty established boundaries between English and Viking control.

- **Legal autonomy**: King Edgar allowed areas of Scandinavian settlement to maintain legal autonomy as a reward for loyalty, while imposing national legislation in cases of theft.

- **Administrative divisions**: The conquered territories were organized under individual kings and numerous jarls, with different Viking armies referred to as 'Northumbrians' or 'East Angles' in the 890s.

### Normans and Normandy

The establishment of Normandy represents a crucial development in Viking settlement:

- **Foundation**: In 911, the west Frankish king granted Rouen and surrounding territory in the lower Seine valley to the Viking leader Rollo, hoping he would prevent other raiders from using the Seine.

- **Expansion**: The Viking occupation proved permanent and became the basis for the later Duchy of Normandy, eventually including the Cotentin in the west.

- **Mixed origins**: Place-names and personal names show that some Scandinavians who settled in western Normandy came from Celtic regions, probably Ireland, with others having spent time in England.

- **Strategic purpose**: Similar to earlier arrangements to protect the Rhine, Normandy served as a buffer territory where Vikings would defend against other Viking raids.

### Rus and the Varangian Guard

The eastern expansion created lasting military and political institutions:

- **Rus identity**: The term "Rus" originally referred specifically to Scandinavians (from Finnish name for Svear) but by the 10th century was no longer used specifically for Scandinavians, having been adopted by the Slavicized ruling class.

- **Varangian warriors**: Scandinavian warriors called "varjagi" in Slavonic (væringar in Old Norse) were recruited by Rus princes in the 10th century for military service.

- **Byzantine connection**: Prince Vladimir (978-1015) sent many varjagi to the Byzantine Empire around 988, enabling the emperor to crush a rebellion. Thereafter, Varangians (both Slavs and Scandinavians) played important roles in the Byzantine army.

- **Imperial Guard**: The Varangians later formed the imperial bodyguard, the Varangian Guard. Notable members included Harald Hardrada before he became king of Norway in 1046.

### Kingdom and State Building

The Viking Age coincided with significant political developments:

- **Danish hegemony**: Danish kings gained wealth and power by controlling tribute and trading places, particularly benefiting from control of Baltic entrance through Store or Lille Bælt.

- **Norwegian unification**: Harald Finehair was traditionally remembered as the first king of a united Norway, with his victory at Hafrsfjord towards the end of the 9th century possibly spurring emigration to Iceland.

- **English unification**: Æthelstan became the first king to unite England after ousting the Viking king of York in 927, though this unity was not permanent until 954.

- **Kievan Rus**: By the end of the 9th century, Kiev was ruled by a dynasty of Scandinavian descent, initially paying tribute to the Khazars but eventually becoming independent.

### Pre-Christian Religion, Christianization

The religious transformation of Scandinavia was a fundamental change:

- **Missionary activity**: Missionaries and later bishops brought not only Christianity but also knowledge of more developed forms of government and opened new channels of communication with other parts of Europe.

- **Gradual conversion**: The conversion process varied by region and social class. Some stone crosses in northern England included representations of Scandinavian deities alongside Christian symbols.

- **Church patronage**: Scandinavian kings of York patronized the church from the 890s, with coins bearing St. Peter's name produced in York in the first decade of the 10th century.

- **Administrative integration**: The inclusion of Norwegian colonies (Orkney, Shetland, Hebrides, Isle of Man, Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland) in the archiepiscopal province of Nidaros in the 12th century demonstrated the closeness of links between Norway and these territories.

## Study Questions Analysis

### 1. Can we define this period? How do we do it? When did it begin and end, or why did it begin and end?

**Definition and Chronology:**

The Viking Age can be defined as a period of approximately 300 years beginning at the end of the 8th century when Scandinavians became prominent figures in European history. The sources provide clear chronological markers:

**Beginning (late 8th century):**
- **793**: Lindisfarne monastery plundered - first recorded raid on British Isles
- **794**: Another attack on Northumbrian monastery
- **795**: Vikings attacked undefended island monasteries in the west
- **799**: First recorded Continental raid on St. Philibert's monastery on Noirmoutier

**Causation for beginning:**
- Commercial expansion in north-west Europe from late 7th century created wealth that attracted raiders
- Familiarity with western European sailing ships led to adoption of sails in Scandinavia
- Political consolidation under Danish kings created pressure that drove some into exile as raiders
- Population pressure in western Norway may have contributed to early colonization efforts

**End (mid-11th century):**
- **1066**: Harald Hardrada's death at Stamford Bridge marked the end of major Scandinavian invasions
- **1085**: Knut of Denmark's planned invasion of England never materialized
- After 1085, no large-scale attacks by Scandinavians occurred

**Causation for ending:**
- Integration of Scandinavia into Christian Europe changed the nature of kingship and political goals
- Effective defensive measures by established kingdoms reduced opportunities for successful raids
- Development of stronger centralized states in target areas
- Conversion to Christianity altered motivations and methods of expansion

**Why it began and ended:**
The expansion began due to a combination of commercial opportunities, political pressures, and technological advances. It ended as Scandinavia itself became integrated into the broader European political and religious system.

### 2. What sources do we have for this period? How does it affect our understanding of the Vikings that our sources for them are all geographically, culturally, or chronologically distant from them?

**Available Sources:**

**Contemporary sources:**
- Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (though Wessex-based with royal perspective)
- Frankish Annals (including Annals of St-Bertin)
- Irish annals and chronicles
- Royal diplomas and charters
- Coins and runic inscriptions
- Archaeological evidence (grave goods, settlements, hoards)

**Later sources:**
- Durham church writings (11th century onwards)
- Icelandic sagas (13th century and later)
- Skaldic verse (uncertain dating and context)

**Source limitations and their impact:**

**Geographic distance:**
Most written sources come from the targets of Viking activity rather than from Scandinavia itself. This creates several problems:
- We see Vikings primarily through the eyes of their victims
- The perspective is often hostile and may exaggerate destruction
- Internal Scandinavian political and social developments are poorly understood
- Regional variations within Scandinavia are not well documented

**Cultural distance:**
- Christian writers often portrayed Vikings as "heathens" or "gentiles," emphasizing religious differences
- Monastic chroniclers focused on attacks on religious sites, potentially overemphasizing this aspect
- The terminology used by historians has been influenced by selectivity and biases in written evidence

**Chronological distance:**
- Later sources like Icelandic sagas may reflect 13th-century concerns rather than Viking Age realities
- "The value of these late accounts has been increasingly called into question"
- Skaldic verse dating is uncertain, making it difficult to use as reliable contemporary evidence

**Specific impacts on understanding:**
- The focus on raids and destruction may underestimate peaceful trade and settlement
- Political organization within Scandinavian territories is poorly understood due to lack of internal sources
- The role of women and non-elite social groups is largely invisible
- Economic and social motivations may be oversimplified
- Regional and temporal variations in Viking activity are not well captured

**Methodological responses:**
Modern scholarship has responded by:
- Increased reliance on archaeological evidence
- Comparative analysis across different source traditions
- Recognition that impact cannot be simply deduced from numbers
- Greater attention to the "duration of viking rule and the nature of interaction between vikings and English"

### 3. By the end of the Viking Age, Scandinavia had begun to integrate into the rest of Christian Europe. How did this happen?

**The Christianization Process:**

**Missionary activity and royal conversion:**
- Missionaries brought not only Christianity but also "knowledge of more developed forms of government"
- They "opened new channels of communication with other parts of Europe"
- Scandinavian kings began to patronize Christian institutions (e.g., York from the 890s)

**Political integration:**
- **Royal adoption of Christianity changed the nature of kingship:**
  - Towns became centers of both secular and religious authority
  - Cathedrals and major churches became "imposing symbols of the new, Christian kingship"
  - Kings gained benefits from providing protection to traders and craftsmen

**Economic integration:**
- **Commercial expansion:** "The increasing scale and range of commerce across the North Sea and the Baltic to meet the demands of the expanding towns of western Europe"
- **Urban development:** Towns developed "on new sites as well as in such well-established trading places as Ribe"
- **Trade relationships:** Created "many new opportunities for contacts and new influences"

**Administrative and ecclesiastical integration:**
- Establishment of regular bishoprics and cathedral sees
- Integration into broader European ecclesiastical hierarchy
- By the 12th century, the archiepiscopal province of Nidaros included Norwegian colonies, demonstrating formal ecclesiastical links

**Cultural assimilation in settled areas:**
- In England: Development of distinct Anglo-Scandinavian identity in the Danelaw
- Adoption of local customs and languages while maintaining some distinct practices
- Intermarriage and cultural blending created hybrid identities

**Political realignment:**
- Scandinavian rulers began to operate within European diplomatic frameworks
- Marriage alliances with European royal families
- Adoption of European models of statecraft and law

**The role of trade:**
Commercial relationships served as vectors for cultural and religious exchange, creating practical incentives for integration while maintaining profitable relationships with Christian European partners.

### 4. Why was there a Scandinavian expansion, but no Scandinavian empire in the mid-11th century? Why were some of the effects of the Scandinavian expansion lasting, while others were only short-lived?

**Why expansion but no empire:**

**Structural factors preventing empire formation:**

**Geographic dispersion:**
- Scandinavian settlements were scattered across vast distances: from Greenland to Kiev
- No central coordinating authority could effectively control such dispersed territories
- Different regions faced different local conditions requiring distinct approaches

**Political fragmentation:**
- Multiple competing Scandinavian kingdoms (Denmark, Norway, Sweden)
- Internal conflicts within Scandinavian homelands prevented unified imperial project
- Local rulers often became autonomous, as seen in the Slavicization of Kiev rulers

**Integration vs. domination:**
- Successful Scandinavian rulers often became integrated into local power structures rather than maintaining separate imperial identity
- Examples: Norman rulers in France, Rus princes in Kiev, Anglo-Scandinavian nobles in England

**Economic model:**
- The expansion was based on extracting wealth rather than creating integrated administrative systems
- Focus on tribute, trade, and plunder rather than territorial administration
- No unified economic system linking the various Scandinavian settlements

**Lasting vs. short-lived effects:**

**Lasting effects and their causes:**

**Language and place-names:**
- Remained in areas of dense settlement (northern England, Iceland, etc.)
- Caused by actual demographic presence and continued use by settled populations
- Agricultural vocabulary changes indicate genuine farming communities

**Political and legal traditions:**
- Normandy became a lasting political entity that influenced European history for centuries
- Legal traditions in the Danelaw persisted and influenced English law
- These survived because they were institutionalized and served local needs

**Trade networks and urban development:**
- Commercial connections established during Viking Age continued to develop
- Towns founded or expanded during this period often remained important centers
- Economic relationships proved mutually beneficial and self-sustaining

**Religious and cultural synthesis:**
- Christianity adopted by Scandinavians became permanently established
- Cultural blending in settled areas created new, stable identities
- Integration into European political system proved irreversible

**Short-lived effects and their causes:**

**Military conquest without settlement:**
- Areas conquered but not heavily settled often reverted to local control
- Example: Many Viking conquests in Ireland were eventually overcome by Irish rulers
- Lack of demographic permanence meant political control was fragile

**Tribute relationships:**
- Arrangements based on payment of tribute or protection money ended when circumstances changed
- Example: Various tribute arrangements with English kingdoms ceased when recipients were no longer capable of enforcing them

**Political alliances:**
- Temporary alliances between Vikings and local rulers dissolved when interests diverged
- Personal relationships ended with the death of key individuals

**Raiding-based presence:**
- Areas used primarily as bases for further raiding became untenable when raiding opportunities declined
- Example: Withdrawal from many Continental positions when defenses improved

**Key factors determining permanence:**

1. **Demographic settlement:** Areas with substantial Scandinavian population maintained lasting changes
2. **Institutional integration:** Where Vikings became part of existing or new institutions, effects lasted
3. **Economic integration:** Mutually beneficial economic relationships continued beyond political control
4. **Cultural synthesis:** Successful blending of cultures created stable new identities
5. **Geographic sustainability:** Areas that could be maintained given available resources and technology

The fundamental difference was between extractive relationships (which ended when extraction became impossible) and integrative relationships (which created new, self-sustaining systems). The most lasting effects occurred where Scandinavians became part of new synthetic cultures rather than remaining as a separate, dominant group.

## Conclusion

The Scandinavian expansion represents a complex historical phenomenon that transformed medieval Europe through a combination of raiding, trading, settlement, and political integration. While initially driven by opportunities for wealth extraction and political exile, the movement evolved into permanent demographic and cultural changes in many regions. The ultimate integration of Scandinavia into Christian Europe marked not the failure of expansion, but its successful transformation into lasting institutional and cultural legacies that continued to shape European development for centuries to come.

The sources reveal that our understanding of this period remains limited by the perspective of victim societies, but archaeological evidence and comparative analysis continue to refine our comprehension of this pivotal era in European history.
